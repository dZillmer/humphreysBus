# humphreysBus
CDAS work on CP Humphreys Project

# Setup
Project was a data analysis, visualization, and potential simulation request from 8th Army Korea ORSAs. The Garrison on Cp Humphreys wanted to make the bus routes better, and wanted a data-driven analysis to inform the changes. The two main datasets for this analysis are: `busData.csv` and `taxiData.csv`. To help with the visualizations, I had to create the `locationSheet`, `locationDictionary`, and `locationBusOnly` files by manually looking up locations using installation maps and open source imagery from Google. 

# Exploratory Analysis
To conduct the initial exploratory analysis, I used Jupyter Notebooks to import, clean, and help build some visualizations. These can be seen in the `taxiVisualization` and `busAnalysisVisualization` files. Most of the visualizations were interactive, but some of the clips look like:

# Simulation
With a solid idea of what the data looked like, I then set about building some basic SimPy simulations to model the existing route. My basic workflow, as seen across the `busSimulation.py` file iterations (before I began to use Git for version control!), was:
- clean, explore, and analyze data (as seen above)
- identify a metric for success (i.e., in this case, we considered average transit time)
- use data to build ``oriented demand'' data per stop
- use Poisson random variables calibrated off data to estimate basic simulation inputs
- verify simulation works by comparing it to reality
- calculate current route metrics
- using proposed routes, compare new route metrics to old routes to assess which were better

One example of the simulation versus data visualizations is below.
